# Design Guidelines

## Typography:
 - Roboto is a modern, versatile font that looks great and is easy to read on any device.
 - The combination with Arial ensures a web-safe fallback, and the line height and font weights improve readability.

## Color Scheme:
The color palette with calming and professional tones:
- **Background:** A soft #c3bef0 (light purple/blue) gives a calm, trustworthy feel.
- **Header:** Light blue #cadefc makes the section visually distinct without being overwhelming.
- **Section Backgrounds:** #defcf9 adds a gentle contrast, making the content readable.
- **Links:** #007bff (blue) maintains consistency with traditional clickable link colors, improving usability.
